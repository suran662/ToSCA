# ToSCA

This repository contains the high-level code for the ToSCA project. Some low-level code is included, while other components are still under development and will be released soon.

- The `cli/` directory contains command-line tools for training and interacting with models.
- The `models/` and `Trainer/` directories provide model definitions and training logic.
- The `datasets/` directory will host datasets (see its README for details).
- The `utils/` directory includes utility scripts for distributed training, logging, and more.

**Note:** Some low-level modules are marked as "coming soon" and will be added in future updates.

Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute!
